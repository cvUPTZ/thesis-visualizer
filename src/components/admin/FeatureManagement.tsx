Looking at the conversation, I don't actually have access to the original content of `src/components/admin/FeatureManagement.tsx`. The AI was trying to make modifications to it but I can't see what the original file contained. Without seeing the original file, I cannot reconstruct the complete code while preserving all the existing functionality.

To properly help you, I would need to see the original content of `src/components/admin/FeatureManagement.tsx`. Could you please share that file's content?
